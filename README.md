# Runtime performance stats

## Normal JVM version

Here are some performance numbers for this simple project on hardware. With a
new Apple 16" MacBook Pro laptop w/ 64GB RAM and 8 core 5GHz Intel CPU:

1. With about 10_000 client threads, the entire program can run in about 17 sec,
   and the server may wait a few ms at most to accept a connection.
2. 100_000 client threads connecting to a simple socket server, the JVM
   experiences some serious performance issues, w/ threads causing the socket
   server to wait around for a very long time to be able to accept a new socket
   connection, max of about 7 seconds ðŸ˜±, and not a few ms! And the entire
   program takes about 5 minutes to run ðŸ˜¨. BTW, "Grep Console" is a great
   plugin to monitor output from the client and server println statements.
